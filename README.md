## Description

Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, you will analyze different Warby Parker marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that you are given:

### Quiz Funnel: survey

Customers start by taking a 5-question style quiz to find their ideal frames. Our analysis tracks how many users complete each question and provides insights on how to improve the quiz to boost completion rates

### Home Try-On Funnel: quiz, home_try_on, purchase

After the style quiz, customers move on to the home try-on stage and then to purchase. Our analysis tracks conversion rates at each stage and includes an A/B test to see if offering more pairs for home try-on increases the likelihood of purchase


This project was a collaboration with Warby Parker’s Data Science team (thank you!) and uses fictional data.

Let’s get started!
